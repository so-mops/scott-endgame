 Scott's Endgame Project
 ========================

This respository will be documentation of recent projects that I (Scott Swindell) have worked on. The plan is to create one markdown document for each project. These markdown files will each include three things

1. A description of the project with links to the project github page(s).
2. A discusion of any ongoing maintenance of the project or outstanding bugs that need to be fixed. 
3. My thoughts on how the poject should evolve in the future. 


The second section for each project should be fairly short. I want to keep any extended discussion of maintenance located on the poject github pages themselves not here. What you should see instead are links to the extended versions.
