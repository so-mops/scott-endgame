Desktop apps at the Kuiper 61"
==============================

This document covers two applications run from the desktop on the bigobs account on gerard. The two apps are:

1. Paddle [src](https://github.com/so-mops/gui-tools/blob/master/bumppaddle.py)
2. Cancel, Dome and Mirror Covers [src](https://github.com/so-mops/gui-tools/blob/master/safetel.py)


Both these GUI's are written in python2 TKinter. 

Maintenence and Bugs
--------------------

1. The paddle buttons for the dome occasionally cause a dome runaway. The solution to this is to touch 


Future Direction
----------------
These GUI's are written in python2.7 using TKinter. There is a python3 port but I am not sure it is working. It would be best to abandon these tools and incorporate functionality into existing INDI infrastructure.
