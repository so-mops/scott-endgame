VATT Guidebox
--------------

The VATT guidebox was rebuilt in late 2019 with new motors and [new software](https://github.com/so-mops/vatt-guidebox).



Maintenance and Bugs
--------------------

There have been a few problems since the implementation of the new guidebox system. These problems may be caused by low temperatures, software bugs or communication issues or some combination of the three. Descriptions of the problems can be found on the issue list [here](https://github.com/so-mops/vatt-guidebox/issues). 

### Issue List
See the issue list above. 



Future Direction
-----------------

This project could use more logging and some code clean up, but will hopefully stabilize soon.
