## RTS2 Automation and the 61"

Since 2015, Mtnops has been attempting to bring greater automation to the kuiper 61". To do this we used [RTS2](https://rts2.org/) for the software and made several hardware upgrades. 

You can find our fork of RTS2 [here](https://github.com/srswinde/rts2). We also use [rts2solib](https://github.com/so-mops/rts2solib), a python utility.

A usefull resource is the ARTN github page which can be found [here](https://github.com/bjweiner/artn).
